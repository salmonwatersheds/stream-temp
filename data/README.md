# data

Raw data files included here are from two main sources (note that actual data files are quite large and not uplaoded to GitHub):

1) The Water Survey of Canada, which has temperature loggers at some of their stations. These data are provided in the [real-time hydrometric data](https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/search/real_time_e.html), with historical data available by request to Water Survey of Canada <shnhydrologiquebc-nhshydrologicalbc@ec.gc.ca>.

2) The province of BC via the Aquarius data portal. Bulk downloads of water temperature data are available at (https://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/data_searches/water/)[https://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/data_searches/water/] (Contact Rob Williams <Robert.Williams@gov.bc.ca>).
